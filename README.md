# Team Workshop: GIT

This workshop is setup to help understand the basics of GIT and how to get up and running using it.

## Cloning a Repo

```
git clone {repo address}
```

## Making changes and commiting those changes

```
$ git add .
```

```
$ git commit -m "commit message here"
```

```
$ git push
```

## Master Branch vs Other branches

```
$ git checkout -b {branch name}
```
The above is shorthand for

```
$ git branch dev
$ git checkout dev
```

## Merging branches
